NAME
    `Protocol::CassandraCQL' - wire protocol support functions for Cassandra
    CQL3

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the basic constants and other support functions
    required to communicate with a Cassandra database using `CQL3'. It is
    not in itself a CQL client; it simply provides the necessary support
    functions to allow one to be written.

    For a complete client, see instead Net::Async::CassandraCQL.

CONSTANTS
    The following families of constants are defined, along with export tags:

  OPCODE_* (:opcodes)
    Opcodes used in message frames.

  RESULT_* (:results)
    Result codes used in `OPCODE_RESULT' frames.

  TYPE_* (:types)
    Type codes used in `TYPE_ROWS' and `TYPE_PREPARED' column metadata.

  CONSISTENCY_* (:consistencies)
    Consistency levels used in `OPCODE_QUERY' and `OPCODE_EXECUTE' frames.

FUNCTIONS
  $name = typename( $type )
    Returns the name of the given `TYPE_*' value, without the initial
    `TYPE_' prefix.

TODO
    *       Reimplement Protocol::CassandraCQL::Frame in XS code for better
            performance.

    *       Support 64bit-challenged perls by using `Math::BigInt' for 64bit
            values
